<!-- I'm just adding some basic HTML to the index page, but the intention is to have
 this thing running with Angular and using it as a tool to help other to learn AngularJS.
 Just added some more files, not content. AngularJS and a couple of dependencies. Lets keep this simple.
 Controllers and routes added. I think this will work as a pretty basic setup.
