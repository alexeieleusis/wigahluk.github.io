        <h1>Setting up this thing</h1>
        <p>I'm starting this... thing. I've started some other blogs, personal pages, etc. in the past. Fore some reason I've never
            maintained them in a regular way.</p>
        <p>I think probably my old blog at Wordpress was the one where I wrote more on but then, once I saw it
            without being signed in and saw a lot of advertisements (not really a lot, but more than what I liked) I lost the interest on it.</p>
        <p>Then I tried tumblr, blogger, twitter (I know it's not the same) and for some reason I don't get really involved with them.</p>
        <p>There are no guaranties that this quasi blog at github will have a better luck, we'll see. There are some things I like so far:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>I can write code directly</li>
            <li>I can have a source control on it</li>
            <li>I can have branches</li>
            <li>I can iterate on it</li>
        </ul>

        <p>So this is pretty much as my first post here. I want to add some more stuff, mainly, I want to be able to write my posts
        using markdown instead of pure HTML, and also have some nice styles for them including something for dates (this post has no timestamp
        nor any other fancy metadata :( ).</p>
        <p>Lets try to add some MD support for this rudimentary blog-like thing.</p>
