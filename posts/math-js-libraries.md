Math JavaScript Libraries
=========================

Data visualization is very related, if not the same to data manipulation. In most of the cases, data visualization tools will handle all the maths and transformations needed to present your data on the screen, but there are times, many in deed if you are working on a data intensive project, were just sending the data to the charting library as it is coming from the data base or an API is not enough. Of course you can go with your own functions, but before taking that path, or because you are taking it, having other tools as reference can be useful. Here are some.


## lodash

It is probably the best array manipulation library out there. Even if you are writing your own tool, using lodash as a dependency for your library is worth to consider. Even if it is not all about math (it has some handy math methods in the latest versions) it is probably the best swiss knife you can get when handling data sets.

It was based originally in [Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/), a very known library, but has evolved into a much better replacement for it, at least thatâ€™s my opinion, you can try both and use whatever you like more.

In case you are interested in a more serious comparison between both, you can read [Underscore vs Lo-Dash](http://benmccormick.org/2014/11/12/underscore-vs-lodash/)

## Sylvester

This one is a linear algebra library dedicated to Vector and Matrix manipulation.

## jStat

Another linear algebra library with a good amount of statistical analysis methods.
