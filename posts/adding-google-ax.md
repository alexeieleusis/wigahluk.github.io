Adding Google Analytics
=======================

I decided to start a new post but continue writing about the process of creating this blog-like thing because now I'll
integrate some other services that are not completely related to the code and infrastructure I need for this application
but rather are more like accessories.
  
I already had an account for google analytics, so the natural next step was to create a new property.
  
The next step: embed the javascript code for this to work.

Finally, because this app is an _angular_ app, I needed a way to track page interactions for a it. I'm using
[angulartics](http://luisfarzati.github.io/angulartics/). For now, I'll keep the very basic configuration.
