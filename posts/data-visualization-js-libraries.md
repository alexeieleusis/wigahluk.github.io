Data Visualization JavaScript Libraries
=======================================


A good part of my job is related to data visualization in a web application. As you probably know, the most recent approach to this problem is to draw the graphical artifacts on the browser, removing some of the extra load from the servers. Because of this, I use to search for JavaScript libraries specialized in charts and time series.

Some of these libraries I have used, some of them I want to try, and some of them I just want to know about. Almost all of them have been as open tabs in my browser for months, waiting to have some time to explore them. Today I'm closing these tabs but listing them all here.
 
## Highcharts

This one is probably one of the most famous ones. It is no open source, but has a pretty good amount of features and if your company can afford the license price, it is probably a good idea to consider.

They offer two versions of their product, the regular one, known simply as Highcharts, that is also the one where more customization can be done, and Highstock, specialized in multi charts and time series.
   
They also offer a minimalist version of their charts for use as a sparkline.

## Plottable

Visually this one is pretty neat and clean. It offers the basic charts: bars, lines and scatters.

## Datakit

This one is a bit more than a chart library. It also includes some neat functionality to do some data analysis.

## Envision

Mainly focused on time series, offers simple but well presented charts. It also support very customized charting, as their fractal example shows.

## JointJS

It covers a very good amount of different needs, from UML to Petri nets, including chess diagrams and organizational charts. It is part of a biggest software that provides a diagramming editor online. The editor has a commercial license, but the library is open source.

## dimple

Works on top of [D3](http://d3js.org) and claims to provide a easier API for creating charts hiding the complexity of D3.
It is also one of cleanest graphically speaking.

## MetricsGraphics

Another library on the top of [D3](http://d3js.org) that also offers neat charts with a minimalistic design.
