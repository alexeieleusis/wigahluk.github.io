Towards the End of Gender Discussion
====================================

I just read [Oregon Court Allows a Person to Choose Neither Sex](http://nyti.ms/1XRRG5D) and was happily shock by it.

Finally, a sentence that makes sense in the context of gender.

Regardless of the funny and nerdy name for this new _no-gender_ gender (“nonbinary”), this is, I believe, the starting point of a more sound and modern path for society.

For law and society we should not be women or men or gay or black or asian or latino or whatever, we should be only people, human beings, persons.

Law and society should give a damn about what do we do with our sexuality, what color is our skin or what religion we like to practice.

For now, and this is only for now because hopefully in the future science would change it, the only importance of gender is when we talk about reproduction. Unfortunately we still need at least one woman and at least one man to be involved in pregnancy. Reproduction is, in my point of view, the only field where we still need to talk about gender when talking about rules, enforced by law or by society.

Marriage, for example, should be a contract that allow two human beings to establish a long term commitment to each other regardless of genders, race or religion.

As for what restroom we should use… well, that discussion should not even exists, telling people what restroom to use is like telling them what seat should they occupy in a bus based on the color of their skin. Having icons for men or women on restrooms is an aberration. People is people and people need to pee regardless of what kind of gametes their body produce. (If the concern is to reduce sexual harassment, the first thing we should realize is that it can happen regardless the gender of the aggressor or the victim’s. We should prevent it in any possible way but without discrimination)

I don’t mean that we should not talk about gender at all. We can and we should talk about gender, as we do about religion, when we talk as individuals, when we talk about what do we think about our selves, how do we want to be looked at by others, etc. (Race is a different matter, I think race should not even be there for individual discourse, the color of our skin is just like our names or our hight, just another personal characteristic and nothing more, race and racial should be abolished from our vocabulary, they don’t even make sense in biological terms)

That’s all I wanted to say and I didn’t want to forget it so I write it down as soon as I wake up. I’ll review it later and publish it.
