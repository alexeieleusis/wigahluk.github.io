====================================

I'm a software developer. When I’m not at work, I’m doing a bit of everything.

Part of that everything is my most recent attempt to keep a blog, this time as a GitHub page at [wigahluk.github.io](https://wigahluk.github.io). 

Just as an exercise I have configured [plato](https://github.com/es-analysis/plato) to create a [report](/plato-report/index.html) for this blog that happens to be an AngularJS application and can be analyzed for complexity in its code.
